Title: The Elm Retreat, October 6-9

Category: The Elm Retreat

During the previous developer retreat (we worked on my Java 8 book), we decided
we wanted to do another one where we try to plow through and figure out enough
of the [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/) to start building the UI for the
[Open-Spaces board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD3S0wlbek0) (a project so
that open-spaces conferences can have their boards in the cloud, rather than
forcing a single physical location). We use Open Spaces during the [Winter Tech
Forum](http://wintertechforum.com) and similar events during the Summer.

This will be an open-source project hosted on Github.

The Elm retreat will be held October 6-9 in [Crested Butte,
Colorado](http://www.visitcrestedbutte.com/).

We are assuming a background in programming but no prior experience with Elm.
Some of us have already studied the language but in general we'll be learning it
on the fly.

Developer retreats are still in the formative stages so there will be no fee,
but you do need to arrange lodging and pay for meals. You can find out about
travel and lodging
