</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>During the previous developer retreat (we worked on my Java 8 book), we decided
we wanted to do another one where we try to plow through and figure out enough
of the Elm language to start building the UI for the open-spaces board. This
will be an open-source project hosted on Github.</p>
<p>The Elm retreat will be held October 6-9 in Crested Butte, Colorado.</p>
<p>We are assuming a background in programming but no prior experience with Elm.
We'll be figuring it out on the fly.</p>
<p>Developer retreats have as little structure as possible, although we have so
far decided that having a topic is beneficial. The goal is to explore that
topic within your current abilities. Regardless of where you are, you'll
certainly be able to learn and contribute something.</p>
<p>You work when you feel like working, play when you feel like playing, and rest
when you need it. We decide what we're doing, and when, as needed. Last time
we seemed to work about 4 hours a day, until we didn't feel like doing that anymore.
It was raining so we only got in one mountain-bike ride, but we also had great
meals and a movie night. We make it up as we go.</p>
<p>Developer retreats are still in the formative stages so there will be no fee,
but you do need to arrange lodging and pay for meals. Crested Butte has
numerous lodging possibilities including AirB&amp;B (my friend Kate has fun and
funky rooms at her house just a block away from mine; <a href="mailto:Kate@KateSeeley.com">email her
directly</a>).</p>
