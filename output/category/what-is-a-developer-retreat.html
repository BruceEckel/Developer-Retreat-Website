</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>A Community of Learning</h1>
<p>Developer retreats have as little structure as possible, although they are
organized around a topic. The goal is to explore that topic within your current
abilities. Regardless of where you are, you'll certainly be able to learn and
contribute something.</p>
<h2>What Happens</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work when you feel like working, play when you feel like playing, and rest
when you need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We decide what we're doing, and when, as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outdoor activities happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meals, movie nights, and more as they arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We make it up as we go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unplanned, interesting things happen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pro&bull;pin&bull;qui&bull;ty /pr&#x259;&#x2c8;piNGkw&#x259;t&#x0113;/</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nearness in place; proximity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearness of relation; kinship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affinity of nature; similarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearness in time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Location</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bruce Eckel&rsquo;s living room, Crested Butte, CO (WiFi, TV Monitor, Printer/Scanner and
    Kitchen). We can comfortably fit 12 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As that fills, and/or for variety, we spill into coffee shops and group houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people are staying in the <a href="http://cbhostel.com/">hostel</a>, that has a nice community space as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Townie&rdquo; bikes can be rented during the event to more easily get around town.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Lodging</h1>
<p>Crested Butte has numerous lodging possibilities including <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirB&amp;B</a>.</p>
<p>My friend Kate has fun and funky rooms at her house just a block away from mine;
<a href="mailto:Kate@KateSeeley.com">email her directly</a>).</p>
<p>My neighbor Dawne, who lives right behind me, also rents a room. You can <a href="mailto:dbelloise@gmail.com">email
her</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a very nice <a href="http://cbhostel.com/">hostel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although you can find lodging&mdash;even nice hotels&mdash;up on the mountain
(called <em>Mount</em> Crested Butte, 3 miles away with a free bus running to town), it's much nicer
to stay in town (just called "Crested Butte," no "Mount"), so try to do that if you can.</p>
<h2>Group Houses</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=vacation%20rentals%20crested%20butte&amp;es_th=1">Here's where to  start looking</a></p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>More fun!</li>
<li>May or may not be cheaper, but generally a nicer experience</li>
<li>Adds an additional workspace</li>
</ul>
<h1>Least-Expensive Travel</h1>
<p>Denver is a hub for Southwest Airlines. Schedule a morning flight, then take the
light rail from the airport to Union Station and catch the 1:55 pm bus to
Gunnison, which arrives at 6:30 pm. From there, Alpine express can bring you to
Crested Butte, or if one of our group is going to be there they can bring you.
Alternatively, check rental car prices from Denver airport (it's a gorgeous
drive), and consider sharing.</p>
